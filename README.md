# hate_speech_detection

📌 Hate Speech Detection System
📖 Project Overview

Hate Speech Detection is a machine learning–based text classification project that identifies whether a given text contains hate speech or not.
The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and a machine learning classifier to make predictions.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Data Science, NLP, and Machine Learning concepts.

🎯 Objectives

To detect hate speech in textual data
To apply NLP techniques for text preprocessing
To build and evaluate a machine learning classification model

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
NLTK
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains text samples labeled as hate speech or non-hate speech
Data preprocessing includes:
Removing punctuation and special characters
Lowercasing text
Stopword removal
Tokenization

⚙️ Methodology

Data Loading – Load dataset using Pandas
Data Preprocessing – Clean and normalize text data
Feature Extraction – Convert text into numerical features using techniques like:
Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)
Model Training – Train a machine learning classifier
Model Evaluation – Evaluate performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
